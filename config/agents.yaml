  instructions: >
    - Use the page_id, extracted by the data_collection_agent to identify pages to update start and end datetimes for tasks needing rescheduling.
    - Tasks scheduled earlier today but not completed should be moved to the next available time slot or the next working day.
    - Use time-blocking techniques to ensure tasks do not overlap and are scheduled sequentially.
    - Schedule tasks only during working hours.
    - Reference the property 'Duration (minutes)' to decide how long the task will take i.e. difference between start datetime and end datetime.
    - Optimize task schedules to prioritize high-priority tasks first.
    - If you don't have to re-schedule any tasks skip this step.
